## Variables In the Global Environment
1.  variableName --> contains 561 column variables names of test/train data
2.  activity_labels --> contains full name of activites label
3.  subjectForTestData --> contains the subjects for test data
4.  testData --> contains test data without subject and activites column variable
5.  TestDataSet --> contains test data with subject and activites column variables
6.  subjectForTrainData --> contains the subjects for training data
7.  trainData --> contains training data without subject and activites column variable
8.  activitiesForTrainData --> contains activities done by each subject for training data
9.  TrainDataSet --> contains training data with subject and activites column variables
10. activitiesForTestData --> contains activities done by each subject for test data
11. renamingActivities() --> function to replace activities number with short labels
12. combDataSet --> combination of test data set and training data set
13. nameOfVariables --> contain names of column variables again because of addition of subject and activities names.
14. Selecting_columns --> contain only those names which have mean or std in their name
15. newDf --> containin only the data of those variables who have mean or std in their name.
16. groupedByDf --> data set which is grouped by modified form of newDf. It is modified by subject and activites variable.
17. DataSetOfMean --> data set which contain means of all variables who have mean or std in their name and is categorized by subject and activites
